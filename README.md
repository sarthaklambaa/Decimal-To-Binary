# Decimal-To-Binary
A Web Application which returns a decimal number into binary number.
Made via Python (Flask) and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)

<h1> Description: </h1>
A web application that converts decimal numbers to binary numbers using Python (Flask), HTML, and Bootstrap CSS provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily convert numbers. The front-end of the application is built using HTML and Bootstrap CSS. The application has a simple input field where the user can enter a decimal number, and a button to initiate the conversion. Once the user submits the decimal number, the Python (Flask) back-end handles the conversion and returns the binary equivalent of the decimal number. The result is displayed to the user in a clear and easy-to-read format. Additionally, the application can include some features in future such as the ability to convert multiple numbers at once, or the option to convert to other number systems such as hexadecimal or octal.
